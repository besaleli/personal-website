# About Me

<img src="assets/headshot.jpg", width=200 align="right">

I’m a ML Systems Engineer at Mozilla.ai, working in an experimental role focused on system-level reliability in AI.

My job operates under a simple premise:

**AI systems are sociotechnical systems, where the only components more unreliable than the AI itself are the humans interacting with it. Someone needs to manage that risk.**

I build infrastructure for making ML systems more resilient under these conditions and work on open-source projects at Mozilla.ai that make model behavior easier to ship, reason about, and constrain.

## Open source

I maintain and contribute to several open-source projects at Mozilla.ai.
Some are direct outputs of the systems-engineering experiment above; others are adjacent infrastructure that became necessary once we started treating failure as a first-class concern.

- [**Encoderfile**](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/encoderfile) — A single-file distribution format and inference engine for transformer-based encoders, designed to be offline, self-contained, and compliance-forward.
- [**Choice-First Stack**](https://www.mozilla.ai/open-tools/choice-first-stack) — Universal interfaces for LLMs, agents, MCP servers, guardrails, and more.
- [**cargo-goose**](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cargo-goose) — A SemVer bumping tool for Rust projects that treats pre-releases and real-world versioning workflows as first-class, instead of edge cases.

Outside Mozilla.ai:

- [**Ptolemy**](https://github.com/PtolemyLovesYou/ptolemy) — An open-source ML observability platform grounded in systems engineering principles

## Previously (pre-Mozilla.ai)

- **Head of AI, Seek AI (acquired by IBM)** — Semantic parsing, text-to-SQL, research → production pipelines.
- **MS, Computational Linguistics — Montclair NLP Lab** — Research in lexical semantic change detections for morphologically rich, low-resource languages
- **BA, St. John's College** — Philosophy, history of science and mathematics

## Writing & collaboration

I occasionally write, teach, and run workshops—usually about:

- why alignment is a systems problem,
- how failures propagate in agentic setups,
- and why benchmarks lie (politely).

## Things I Do Offline

I enjoy cooking, travel, and people with caustic senses of humor. I am obnoxiously proud of being verified at Bassiani, and my favorite subway line is the Q. My favorite authors are Evelyn Waugh, Mikhail Bulgakov, and Giuseppe di Lampedusa.

## Contact

Contact me at raz [at] besaleli [dot] io if you are working on something weird, beautiful, or both.
